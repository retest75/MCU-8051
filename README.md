# Intel 8051 MCU implement

## Intro.

This repository is the implement of MCU. In here, we use Intel 8051 as our core and other peripherals such like LED, DIP switch. The compile environment is Keil C51 but I upload the `main.c` files and some header files. The header files `<AT89X51.h>` or `<REGX51.h>` are not included in these project.

Each folder correspond a small project or implement. You will know what does these project do by its folder name.
